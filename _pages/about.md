# About

My name is Geraldo, I am an R&D Engineer working on developing the next generation of mechanical equipment (machines or structures) using mathematical modeling and analytical, numerical, and experimental analysis tools. Throughout my career, I  have been generating insights into the behavior of mechanical systems via a balanced combination of reasoning, modeling, and data analysis. I am a Postdoctoral fellow at [NTNU](https://www.ntnu.edu/imt/lab/md-lab) in Norway working with maritime machinery, with emphasis on gearboxes for the wind industry and more recently on reciprocating compressors.

# Background

I have extensive education in Mechanical Engineering, with a Ph.D. from [DTU](https://www.mek.dtu.dk/english) in Denmark and masters and bachelors degrees from [UFRN](https://www.ufrn.br/en) in Brazil. During this time I have researched nonlinear vibrations. [At DTU, I investigated the advantages and shortcomings of different models and assumptions for vibro-impacting systems, against experimental observations.](/portfolio/PhD_thesis) At UFRN, I worked on the stabilization of unstable states in chaotic mechanical systems using sliding mode control. After my Ph.D., I started working at NTNU, where [I am developing methodologies for cheaper testing of wind turbine gearboxes and components via down-scaled modeling procedures.](/publication/A3)
