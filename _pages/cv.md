Summary
======
I am an engineer with a continuous-learning mindset, focused on achieving high-quality results. With a continuous interest to learn and improve my skill set, I am a self-motivated professional with a can-do attitude, working in teams or alone. I have a Ph.D. degree in Mechanical Engineering from DTU, working with modeling, analysis and experimental investigations on vibro-impact systems.
My core **technical expertise** is on mechanical vibrations: modeling, analysis, and validation of mathematical models and experimental modal analysis (EMA).

Previous research projects
======
* Jul/2014--Oct/2018: **Vibro-Impact Mechanics -- Analytical, Numerical and Experimental Investigations**
	* [Technical University of Denmark -- DTU](http://www.mek.dtu.dk/english)
	* Description:
	Roughly speaking, vibro-impacts are characterized by repeated collisions between objects or internal machine components whose movement is constrained by physical barriers, such as stops and clearances. This phenomenon is very common in engineering applications, being useful in some cases and problematic in others. While vibro-impacts can improve the performance of some devices, like concrete breakers, hammering, riveting and drilling devices, it also produces noise and wear in loose-joints, heat-exchangers and gear-pairs. The coefficient of restitution and contact forces are the most common ways to model vibro-impact systems. In this Ph.D. project, the **advantages and disadvantages** of those model approaches **are discussed and compared against experimental observations**. Different impact situations are tested experimentally, from hard unilateral impacts with tightened, neutral or loose gaps, to bilateral soft collisions. Common ground model comparisons are made by correlating analytical and numerical model predictions to experimental results. It is shown that both models are able to capture some important properties of vibro-impact systems, producing qualitative insight into their dynamic behavior.

* Aug/2010--Jun/2014: **Nonlinear control in the development of smart mechanical systems**
	* [Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte -- UFRN](https://www.ufrn.br/en)
	* Description:
	In this research group we combined nonlinear control techniques, such as adaptive or variable structure controllers, with intelligent algorithms, as for instance fuzzy logic and artificial neural networks. The proposed strategies are intended to deal with the nonlinear characteristics as well as with modeling imprecisions and external disturbances that can arise.
