Summary
======
I am an engineer with a continuous-learning mindset, focused on achieving high-quality results. With a continuous interest to learn and improve my skill set, I am a self-motivated professional with a can-do attitude, working in teams or alone. I have a Ph.D. degree in Mechanical Engineering from DTU, working with modeling, analysis and experimental investigations on vibro-impact systems.
My core **technical expertise** is on mechanical vibrations: modeling, analysis, and validation of mathematical models and experimental modal analysis (EMA).
