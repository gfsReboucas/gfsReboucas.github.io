I served as Teaching Assistant for the course [Dynamics of machinery](https://kurser.dtu.dk/course/41514) at [DTU Mechanical Engineering](https://www.mek.dtu.dk/english) between 2015 and 2016. My job was to aid students on the preparation of the course project. That was an compulsory activity of my PhD.
