This work was presented in an online poster session at the [Torque 2020 Conference](https://www.torque2020.org/) in Delft, The Netherlands. See the poster [here](/talks/TORQUE_2020).

## Highlights
- Development of a step by step method to down-scale industrial geared drivetrains, while preserving its core properties (resonance distribution and gear structural integrity).
- Results show that it is possible to obtain a scaled gearbox to 0.01 % of its rated power while having less than 10% deviation on pitting safety level.
- Quantitative comparison: NREL 5MW to 500, 50, 5, and 0.5 kW.
- Simple method with increasing detail level according to user needs.
- Scaling relations are obtained from numerical data.

## Abstract
Gearbox testing is an important and complex task that will become even more challenging as the wind industry moves towards ever-growing turbines. The burden of this task can be decreased by using reduced-scale models with similar characteristics as its industrial-scale equivalent. This work presents a step-by-step procedure to down-scale a gearbox to different fractions of its rated power while preserving its core properties: structural safety and frequency distribution. The parameters to be scaled are sub-divided according to their relation to the system's integrity and dynamic behavior. After performing an overall scaling, it is possible to fine-tune the scaling factors, according to the user precision requirements. Simulations show that it is possible to down-scale a gearbox to 0.01 % of its rated power while having less than 10 % relative deviation on its pitting safety factor. These preliminary results show that wind turbine drivetrain testing can become more affordable by using down-scaled models in a structured manner.
