## Highlights
- Comparison of three different impact force models.
- Simple analytical frequency-amplitude relations are obtained and experimentally validated for the impact force models considered.
- Parameter analysis of the impact force models.

## Abstract
The frequency response of a single degree of freedom vibro-impact oscillator is analyzed using Harmonic Linearization, Averaging and Numeric Simulation, considering three different impact force models: one given by a piecewise-linear function (Kelvin-Voigt model), another by a high-order power function, and a third one combining the advantages of the other two. Experimental validation is carried out using control-based continuation to obtain the experimental frequency response, including its unstable branch.
