To observe and understand different aspects of vibro-impacting systems, I have planned different experimental campaigns during my Ph.D. work. This experience can be useful while testing different aspects of new prototypes or troubleshooting critical systems, reproducing unexpected machine behavior.

*Various versions of the experimental setup. (a) with contacts on the beam and magnetic actuators on the lumped mass. (b) with unilateral contacts at the lumped mass. (c) with unilateral impacting spring at the lumped mass.*

The experimental setup was modified several times to observe the influence of several factors, such as contact stiffness, gap width, and frequency and amplitude of excitations. In figure (a), one can see magnetic actuators around the mass and contacts applied around the beam, leading to impacts with relatively high duration. In figure (b), unilateral contacts at the right-hand side of the mass led to asymmetric oscillations and impacts with short duration. Theoretical predictions about the influence of the gap size in this configuration were observed experimentally. Finally, the influence of the contact stiffness was investigated by using different helical springs as shown in figure (c).
