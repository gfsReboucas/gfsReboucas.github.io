Literature is full of models for the same phenomenon, making it difficult for engineers to quickly the most appropriated one for its application. That is also the case for impacts, which are one of the most common physical phenomena in nature, being problematic in some applications (gear pairs) and useful in others (hammering). During my Ph.D., I established the applicability ranges for different models for impacting systems according to problem aspects, such as contact duration.

The experimental work made me familiar to signal conditioners, filters, sensors and actuators. While spending some time at the lab troubleshooting and fine-tuning the experimental setup by myself, made me more resilient towards my objectives, improving by trial and failure. Information from different sources (articles, experiments, simulations, etc.) were absorbed and combined to generate qualitative insights on the behavior of mechanical systems. These abilities can be useful in different industrial contexts, from analyzing the viability of new products and processes or malfunctions of complex mechanical systems, to motivating colleagues to have a positive result-oriented approach towards challenges.

The figure above gives an overview of the problem-solving approach I used during my Ph.D. research. On the left side you can see a photo of the experimental setup, together with its schematic representation, showing its main components. Its consists of a cantilever beam with a lumped mass attached and base excitation. On the right side, you can see a common-ground comparison of experimental, analytical (perturbation), and numerical results. Three different model formulations were employed and compared. These results are for the frequency response of the vibro-impacting beam around its fundamental harmonic. Unstable oscillation states were stabilized using magnetic actuators ($F_{mag}$) and can be seen on the lower part of the bent peaks.

The ease of use and reliability of common impact models was tested using analytical, numerical and experimental tools. Despite the complexity of contact problems, I could use analytical tools to explain the experimental results, confirming theoretical predictions made by others. Limitations of the experimental setup and its effect on results were discussed.
